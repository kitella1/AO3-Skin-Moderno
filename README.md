# AO3-Skin-Moderno
The CSS code required for a complete re-skin of Archive of Our Own

## Welcome to Moderno! ##
If you're visiting this repository, chances are you've read the 3rd installment of 'Arrested (Web) Development' on Dev.to. If not, welcome anyway!

The CSS code included in this repository can be pasted into the skin editor of AO3 to give the site a more fresh, modern appearance. 

Feel free to fork the repository and make any improvements or updates. Together we can build a great thing.

## How do I make a skin? ##
If you've never created a skin on AO3 before, fear not. It's very simple to do. Simply log in to your AO3 account and find the 'Skins' option from the menu on the right-hand menu of your Dashboard. The URL will look something like the link below:
https://archiveofourown.org/users/[yourUsername]/skins

From within this menu, locate the 'Create Site Skin' button and et voila: you're halfway there. 

### What settings does Moderno require? ###
If you're looking to recreate this skin, ensure the 'Advanced' skin settings are as follows:
- What it does: 'add on to archive skin'
- IE Only: leave blank
- Parent only: leave unchecked
- media: leave all unchecked
  
### Where is the Moderno CSS? ###
In this repository, you will find the code you need under the Moderno folder, in the Moderno.css file.
